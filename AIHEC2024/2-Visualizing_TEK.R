# in this part, we are loading in a new dataset with the TEK site rankings, and summarizing it to combine with our water quality data
# the end result is a plot that includes both the water quality metrics and ranking of TEK site

# we will use more tidyverse functions and ggplot for plotting 
# new functions include: pivot_longer, inner_join 
# if you are starting from the beginning and have not recently done part 1: Kavi_Tribe_Water_Quality.R, you may want to load your packages and set your working directory

# with TEK data - we are going to 'clean', summarize and combine with water quality data, and plot 

#delete unnecessary timestamp column
# in this example we are selecting every column except the one listed, we use a negative sign to say "Don't Select"
tek_values <- tek_values %>%
  select(-"Timestamp")

#convert the data from a wide format to a long format

# more info for pivot longer - we are reshaping data frame so that rather than several columns, we have only 2 columns to summarize by site  - 
# as good practice in general - we want each column to be a variable and each row to be an observation - in this case it is two variables: site and rank 
# link to visualize pivot_longer: https://epirhandbook.com/en/images/pivoting/pivot_longer_new.png


# we can visualize the data as-is before summarizing 
# because we pivoted longer, we can make the 'site' variable a color in our plots 
ggplot(tek_sites, aes(y=tek_value, x=site, col=site)) + geom_boxplot()


# based on photo, each monitoring site is located relatively close to one of the cultural sites, we will pair each one below 
tek_sites$sample_location = NA # create a new column and fill with empty rows

# next assign values to sample_location based on site rows 
# the following formatting is assigning a value to the rows wherever the statement inside the bracket is true
# for example: 
# dataframe$new_column[dataframe$existing_column=="existing label"] <- "new label"

# monitoring site 1 pairs with ceremony site
tek_sites$sample_location[tek_sites$site=="Ceremony.Site"] <- "Monitoring Site 1"
# monitoring site 2 pairs with medicinal foods site
tek_sites$sample_location[tek_sites$site=="Medicinal.Food.Site"] <- "Monitoring Site 2"
# monitoring site 3 pairs with hunting grounds
tek_sites$sample_location[tek_sites$site=="Hunting.Grounds"] <- "Monitoring Site 3"
# monitoring site 4 pairs with fishing site
tek_sites$sample_location[tek_sites$site=="Fishing.Site"] <- "Monitoring Site 4"
# monitoring site 5 pairs with language camp
tek_sites$sample_location[tek_sites$site=="Language.Camp"] <- "Monitoring Site 5"

# see we have added a third column that labels the closest monitor site
